  "Shoemaking and Related Machine Operators Plant Scheduling
  Coordination Advisor — proposing a plant scheduling/logistics
  coordination operation (log a work record, schedule a crew
  operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a
  leather/sole/adhesive-materials supply order) from a crew roster,
  facility registration and safety-reporting policy. Swappable
  mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes — `shoecoord.governor`
  independently gates every proposal and always escalates safety
  concerns and above-threshold supply orders. The advisor never
  proposes to directly finalize a machine-operation-execution decision
  (e.g. deciding to proceed with a specific pressing/cutting/stitching
  run), or a plant-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring the
  plant safety cleared), and never proposes to override a plant
  safety officer's judgment — those stay permanently out of this
  actor's scope. Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-8143's
  papercoord.advisor.
